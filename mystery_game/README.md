# Mystery Game

This is my own implementation of the mystery game that Michael Littman and Charles Isbell
play in "Lesson 2 - Reinforcement Learning Basics" of the MOOC.

I found it very interesting and educational and I deceided to make my own remake. I use it
with my friends when I want to explain reinforcement learning basics.

## Demo

You can see a <a href="https://programmingheroes.blogspot.com/2016/02/udacity-reinforcement-learning-mystery-game.html">demo</a> in my blog (post written in spanish).

## How to use

The aim of this game is to experiment how computers learn. Open `index.html` in a browser and press keys from 1 to 6 to do actions. You need to learn what the actions produce and how to win the game.

Some rewards values appears when you do the things very well or very bad. When you finish the game the phrase "You Win :)" appears in the board. Good luck!
