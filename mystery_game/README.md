# Mystery Game

This is my own implementation of the mystery game that Michael Littman and Charles Isbell
play in "Lesson 2 - Reinforcement Learning Basics" of the MOOC.

I found it very interesting and educational and I deceided to make my own remake. I use it
with my friends when I whant to explain reinforcement learning basics.
